InboxOutbox
=============

The target of InboxOutbox is to allow users make edits to
remote stores that they did not subscribe to and therefore
have no local copies to avoid issues when loosing internet
connection or working offline.

1. Caches objects loaded from unsubscribed remotes.
2. Stores changes to unsubscribed remotes.


Idea
------

Could use SessionStorage API.
